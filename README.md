# Ajax Checkbox #

Version: 1.0

Makes the checkbox field editable inline in the table publish view.
Value is saved right away.

### KNOWN LIMITATIONS

- Due to the way Symphony's selection works in the table mode, ajax checkboxes can't be in the last column.
- It is now compatible with the `unpublishedfilter` extension.

### REQUIREMENTS ###

- Symphony CMS version 2.3.4 and up (as of the day of the last release of this extension)
